How To Use Simple Dialogue System:

YOU MUST HAVE TMPRO INSTALLED!

Unity Version: 2021.3.9f1

1. create a UI Cancas, put Dialogue Manager Prefab into your scene, make sure the Dialogue Manager is in your canvas
2. Import your Dialogue. The dialogue should follow the format "CharacterName" + : + "Dialogue"
3. In the DialogueManager Inspector, put the link to your txt file in the filepath field (YOU MUST put .txt after the path) eg. Assets/Dialogue/SampleDialogue.txt
4. Import character portrait if you have any. If you don't want to use portraits, DELETE the allPortraits and allCharacterNames list in DialogueManager by setting the item number to 0
5. (optional)If you want to use portraits, put the sprites in allPortraits List in DialogueManager, and their corresponding name in the allCharactersName List (Put them in the same index)

You can also display different dialogues by calling the StartDialogue() function and changing the filepath in DialogueManager
